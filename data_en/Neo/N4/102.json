Your opponent guesses whether it is a Pokémon card with Light in its name, a Pokémon card with Dark in its name, or neither one. Flip the card over. If your opponent guessed right, he or she draws 3 cards. If your opponent guessed wrong, you draw 3 cards. Either way, return the card to your hand.",
