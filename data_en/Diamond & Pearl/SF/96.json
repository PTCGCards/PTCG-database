As long as you have Dusknoir LV.X as a Stadium card in play, put 1 damage counter on each of your opponent’s Pokémon between turns. If another Stadium card comes into play or Dusknoir LV.X is discarded by the effects of any attacks, Poké-Powers, Poké-Bodies, Trainer, or Supporter cards, return Dusknoir LV.X to your hand."
