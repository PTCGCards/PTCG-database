Mysterious Fossil has no attacks of its own, can’t retreat, and can’t be affected by any Special Conditions. If Mysterious Fossil is Knocked Out, it doesn’t count as a Knocked Out Pokémon. (Discard it anyway.) At any time during your turn before your attack, you may discard Mysterious Fossil from play.",
