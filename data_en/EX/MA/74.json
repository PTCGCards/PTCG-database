If that Pokémon is Knocked Out, discard this card.\nWhenever an attack from the Pokémon that Strength Charm is attached to does damage to the Active Pokémon (after applying Weakness and Resistance), the attack does 10 more damage. At the end of the turn in which this happens, discard Strength Charm.",
