If that Pokémon was evolved in this way, that player may search their deck for a Stage 2 Pokémon that evolves from that Pokémon and put it onto that Pokémon to evolve it. Then, that player shuffles their deck. (Players can’t evolve a Basic Pokémon during their first turn or a Basic Pokémon that was put into play this turn.)",
